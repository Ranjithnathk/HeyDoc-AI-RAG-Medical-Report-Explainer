On imaging reports, it is often described as having a curvilinear interface with the aerated lung, resembling a meniscus shape. In supine patients, the fluid may layer posteriorly, creating a hazy opacity over the hemithorax.\n\n- Pleural effusions can widen the pleural space and may show variable attenuation on CT scans, which can also depict loculations and pleural thickening when contrast is used [1].\n- The characteristic meniscus shape occurs as the pleural fluid settles dependently within the pleural space [2].\n- In a supine position, the effusion may appear as a hazy opacity covering the entire hemithorax [2].\n- Imaging may also show loss of normal anatomical structures, such as the hemidiaphragm, due to the silhouette sign phenomenon [3].\n\nI don't know based on the provided sources if there are other specific imaging characteristics or classifications of pleural effusions.\n\nImportant: I am not a doctor and this is not medical advice.

      "answer": "In radiology reports, the term \"unremarkable study\" typically means that the imaging results show no significant abnormalities or findings that would require further investigation. It indicates that the examined area appears normal based on the imaging.\n\n- \"Unremarkable\" suggests that there are no clinically significant findings, which can be reassuring for both the ordering provider and the patient [4].\n- The use of clear language in reports helps avoid misunderstandings and provides direct answers to clinical questions [1].\n- An unremarkable result can help in distinguishing benign findings from those that may need attention [4].\n\nI don't know based on the provided sources.\n\nImportant: I am not a doctor and this is not medical advice.

      "answer": "Ground-glass opacity (GGO) refers to a specific appearance on imaging, particularly on CT scans, where there is a hazy area in the lung that does not obscure the underlying structures. This can indicate various conditions and is characterized by a partial filling of air spaces in the lungs.\n\n- Ground-glass opacities can be seen in various distributions, such as geographic or multifocal patterns, indicating different underlying processes [1][2].\n- They are often associated with conditions that affect the lung parenchyma, such as inflammation or interstitial lung disease [1].\n- The term \"ground-glass\" describes the translucent quality of the opacity, which allows some visibility of the lung structures beneath it [3].\n\nI don't know based on the provided sources.\n\nImportant: I am not a doctor and this is not medical advice.
